# frogpuzzle
m frogs are at the most left and n toads are at the most right. How many minium steps to completely  switch positions of frogs and toads? 

Modify FrogAndToad.cpp to use <algorith> functions instead of one loop function containing converting to big capital character, finding the '_' position, calculating numbers of 'F' and 'T' and judging whether more '_' or other characters exist. Although O(n) scanning string happens more than once, using API will gurantee validality and readility of codes.
